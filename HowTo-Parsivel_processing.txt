That's a quick manual on what to do if you moved the LACROS site or if you have to reset data processing
(1) Within the script 'parsivel2nc.py' update the location info accordingly for the new site

(2) To set the Station Name for the current site
echo -en "CS/K/Leipzig\r\n" > /dev/ttyUSB0

(3) To set the standard data transfer telegram so that data can be interpreted with parsivel2nc.py script:
echo -en "CS/M/S/%19;%20;%21;%09;%22;%23;%25;%13;%16;%17;%18;%10BREAK%01;%02;%03;%04;%07;%08;%12;%11;%24;%34BREAK%93;BREAK%90;BREAK%91;BREAK,\r\n" > /dev/ttyUSB0

(4) The script is automatically run every 30 seconds via a cronjob. Check by if cronjobs are activated by typing crontab -l
